    <p><br>Food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.
        Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of children under age 5 and up to 4% of adults.<br><br> While there's no cure, some children outgrow their food allergies as they get older. Researchers estimate that 32 million Americans have food allergies, including 5.6 million children under age 18. Thatâ€™s one in 13 children, or roughly two in every classroom.
        Studies published in 2018 and 2019 estimate the number of Americans of all ages who have convincing symptoms of allergy to specific foods:

<!-- <p>It's easy to confuse a food allergy with a much more common reaction known as food intolerance. While bothersome, food intolerance is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system. Depending on the type of food intolerance you have, you may be able to eat small amounts of problem foods without a reaction. By contrast, if you have a true food allergy, even a tiny amount of the food may trigger an allergic reaction.
