1,milk,"Milk allergy�is an adverse�immune reaction�to one or more�proteins�in�cow's milk.�Reported prevalence in early childhood ranges between 2-6%, but is outgrown in up to 90% of cases by the age of 6 years and affects few adults. An allergic reaction to milk usually begins within minutes of ingestion. Symptoms: hives, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, tingling or swelling of your lips."
2,egg,"It is due to a�type I hypersensitivity�reaction of the�immune system�in susceptible individuals.�The allergy is recognized ""as one of the most severe food allergies due to its prevalence, persistency, and potential severity of allergic reaction.� Research has shown up to 20 percent of individuals with a peanut allergy eventually outgrow it. Symptoms: Indigestion, pale skin, fainting, difficulty in breathing, drop in blood pressure."

4,wheat,"Wheat allergies, like�hay fever�and other allergies, develop when the body�s�immune system�becomes sensitized and overreacts to wheat in the environment that typically causes no problem in most people. Wheat allergies tend to develop in infancy, often alongside other food allergies. It will usually resolve by the time a person is�12 years of age. Symptoms: skin rash, headaches, asthma, anaphylaxis, stuffy nose."
5,sesame,"The allergic reaction is an�immune hypersensitivity�to�proteins�and�lipophilic�proteins in sesame seeds and foods made with sesame seeds, including food-grade�sesame oil.�Sesame allergy persists into older childhood and adulthood; an estimated 20�30% of affected people develop tolerance. Sesame reactions can range from a mild sensitivity to a severe allergy. Symptoms: hoarse voice, itchiness in throat, redness in the face, swelling."
6,soy,"It is a�hypersensitivity�to ingesting�compounds�in�soy�, causing an overreaction of the�immune system. Acute�soy allergy can have fast onset (from seconds to one hour) or slow onset (from hours to several days), depending on the conditions of exposure. Although most children outgrow soy allergy, some may have the allergy persist into adulthood. Symptoms: runny nose, nausea, wheezing, itchy mouth."
7,mustard,"Mustard is one of the�most common spice allergies. The primary allergen in yellow mustard is �Sin a 1.� The enzymes don�t break down much in the digestive tract, and the allergen is present even if the mustard is cooked in food. The major allergen in brown mustard is �Bra j 1.� Symptoms: feeling lightheaded, nasal congestion, facial flushing, skin rash."
8,fish,"Fish allergy�is an�immune hypersensitivity�to�proteins�found in�fish. Symptoms can be either rapid or gradual in onset. The latter can take hours to days to appear. Fish allergy tends to first appear in school-age children and persist in adulthood. Adult onset of fish allergy is common in workers in the fish catching and processing industry. Symptoms: hives, itching of eyes, pale skin, difficulty swallowing."
9,shellfish,"Shellfish allergy is an atypical response by the body's immune system to proteins in certain marine animals. Some people with shellfish allergy react to all shellfish, while others react to only certain kinds. A shellfish�allergy�is different from an�allergy to fish. Those who are allergic to shellfish do not necessarily have to avoid fish. Reactions range from mild symptoms. Symptoms: coughing, nasal stuffiness, nausea, dizziness."
